		<li> Snakes and Ladders originated in ancient India, where it was known as Mokshapat or Moksha Patamu. The game was played at a time as early as 2nd century BC. Originally, the game was used as a part of moral instruction to children. The squares in which ladders start were each supposed to stand for a virtue, and those housing the head of a snake were supposed to stand for an evil. </li>
